This repository represents a sixth of a full-sized vacation booking application, which was built as separate repositories for separate functional areas.

This is the reviewing functional area's main web application interface. Users can view the properties they have vacationed at, leave reviews, and edit past reviews. Reviews consist of a 1-5 star rating and a comment. This repository hosts a Spring Boot application that will allow the user to interact with the interface via the web browser.

The application makes API calls to two separate microservices to update and retrieve data.

Note: this application requires all six functional area applications to be running in order to properly function. It is a functional example of a software architecture built around subdomains rather than a monolith. It was created with a team of three students during the Fall 2023-2024 semester as a school project.
